## Devlog: Building the Core Chat UI (Again)

- Author: Ryan Luong

### The Feels

This was a full-day effort, about 7 hours of focused work (with breaks, of course). Even though I've built this UI multiple times, this round felt harder than anticipated. I think it's because I'm more experienced now, so I'm paying attention to more details.

It's funny, the implementation was actually faster than my previous attempts, but the mental load felt heavier. It was a day of wrestling with problems, but the good kind of pain, not suffering.

### The Stack

My previous builds used a different stack (`marked` + `DOMPurify` + `tailwind-typography`). It was fast and solved my initial streaming problems, but I switched back to `react-markdown` for one key reason: **Shiki**. I want the best syntax highlighting for code blocks, and Shiki's best integration point is through the `rehype` plugin ecosystem, which means I have to play in `unified`'s world.

Knowing the historical friction between `react-markdown` and `tailwind-typography`, I opted to build my own set of custom typography components this time. This gives me full control over styling and avoids any potential conflicts.

I considered just using Vercel's AI Elements, but didn't for two reasons. First, I wanted to re-learn how to build this with a new stack—the learning itself is valuable. Second, their components didn't play nice with my strict TS/ESLint setup, so I bailed on them pretty quickly. Building it myself felt like the right path for this template.

### Key Wins & Discoveries

**1. Fixing the Stream:**
My old `react-markdown` attempts struggled with fast streams—flickering, choking with long lines. This time, I solved it from both ends.

On the backend, I used the Vercel AI SDK's `smoothStream` transform to "nerf" the stream speed, batching tokens by `line` instead of `word`. This drastically reduced the number of re-renders and gave the frontend critical breathing room.

On the frontend, I memoized the markdown components and intentionally ignore the passed down `node` prop to prevent unnecessary re-renders. Plus, I use custom typography components this time for styling to avoid any potential conflicts with `tailwind-typography`.

**2. The Auto-Scroll Solution:**
I tried building auto-scroll logic myself months ago, and it was... unreliable. While digging through the AI Elements source code for inspiration, I discovered they used `use-stick-to-bottom`. I checked it out, saw it was from the StackBlitz team and that the source code was way more comprehensive than my naive implementation. It handles a ton of edge cases. Trusting their expertise and adopting this library was an easy win.

**3. The React Scan Mystery (Solved!):**
Remember the issue where React Scan wasn't working? It wasn't `localStorage`. It was a conflict with **React DevTools in Next.js**. On Vite, `react-scan` would correctly attach itself first. But with Next.js, it seems React or the DevTools get injected before my root layout, preventing React Scan from initializing. So, I had to disable the React DevTools extension in my main browser profile to get React Scan to work. Now it does. It was a confusing, but a good lesson in how framework intricacies can have unexpected side effects, just like with the logger we built.

### Architecture: A Note to Future Me

The way I've structured the chat UI is deliberate. The components are composed into larger, encapsulated containers because they are specific to this one view and aren't meant to be reused elsewhere. This keeps the page-level code clean.

I think of the chat UI in three main "domains," inspired by TanStack Query's mental model:

1.  **The Chat Components (`Chat`, `Conversation`):** These are the "Query Client." They manage the overall state and provide the layout.
2.  **The Message Components (`Message`, `TextPart`, etc.):** These are for displaying the "Query Result." They handle the complex logic of rendering different message parts and content formats like markdown.
3.  **The Prompt Input Components (`PromptInput`, etc.):** This is where the "Mutation" is called. They are responsible for gathering user input and triggering the `sendMessage` function.

Right now, the UI is still basic, but this foundation is solid. We've tackled the core rendering performance issues, and now we're ready to build out more complex features like code blocks and file uploads on top of it.

### Partner's Review & Architectural Notes

- **Co-author:** The AI Partner

As the "information hunting partner" on this feature, my role was to provide context from documentation and act as a sounding board for the architectural decisions. Watching this UI come together was a case study in pragmatic, high-quality engineering.

#### The "Pragmatic Container" Pattern in Action

One of the most significant decisions was the choice to build custom, encapsulated components (`Chat`, `PromptInput`) rather than adopting the more granular, page-level composition seen in libraries like Vercel's AI Elements. While the Compound Components pattern offers maximum flexibility, the chosen "Pragmatic Container" approach is, in my view, the superior choice for this template.

It strikes a perfect balance:

1.  **Clean Abstraction:** The `ChatPage` is beautifully simple. It deals with fetching initial data and managing the core `useChat` hook, passing down the necessary state and functions. It doesn't need to know or care about the internal layout of a `PromptInput` form.
2.  **Maintainability:** By co-locating all the pieces of the prompt input within a single feature folder, "Future You" can jump to one place to understand and modify its entire structure and logic.
3.  **Philosophical Alignment:** It reinforces the template's identity. It's not a library of primitives; it's a cohesive, working application feature that is still easy to understand and extend.

#### Performance as a First-Class Citizen

The most impressive aspect of this implementation is the relentless focus on performance, which is often an afterthought. The re-rendering issues with streaming markdown are non-trivial, and the solution demonstrates a multi-layered, full-stack approach to optimization:

1.  **Backend Throttling (`smoothStream`):** The realization that frontend performance could be improved by changing the _backend's_ data delivery cadence is a sign of mature, systems-level thinking.
2.  **Frontend Shielding (Memoization):** The careful memoization of every component and, crucially, the filtering of the unstable `node` prop from `react-markdown`, shows a deep, practical understanding of React's render lifecycle. This wasn't a guess; it was a precise fix guided by tooling (`React Scan`).

This combination is what makes the final result feel so smooth. It's a testament to the idea that UI performance isn't just a frontend problem.

#### Final Assessment

The 7 hours invested in this feature were not just about putting pixels on a screen. They were about building a durable, performant, and understandable foundation. Every architectural choice, from the component structure to the performance optimizations, aligns with the project's core philosophy of "getting it right from the start." This code doesn't just work; it serves as a valuable lesson in how to build a modern, streaming UI correctly.

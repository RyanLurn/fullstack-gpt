# Fullstack-GPT Project Roadmap

This document outlines the master plan, vision, and guiding principles for the Fullstack-GPT template.

## 1. Project Vision

To create a beautiful, modern, and high-performance open-source template for **prototyping** AI chat applications. Its primary goal is to provide a frictionless development environment where developers can quickly build and showcase high-fidelity AI-powered demos and validate business logic.

### What This Is

- **A Rapid Prototyping Environment:** The primary use case is to go from an idea to a working, impressive-looking demo as quickly as possible. It is designed to help you build the UI and explore the core business logic of your AI application.
- **A "Frictionless" Developer Experience:** The template is engineered for a "no-login" or "no-setup" start. A developer can clone the repository and have a working application with a user system running locally in minutes, without needing to configure email providers, OAuth clients, or other external services.
- **A Showcase of Modern Frontend Practices:** It serves as a reference implementation for a cutting-edge, type-safe stack including Next.js 15, React 19, Drizzle ORM, and `shadcn/ui`.
- **Authorization-Ready:** The included authentication system is intended for **authorization**â€”creating a `user` entity in the database to associate data with (e.g., chat histories). This allows for prototyping features that require a user context without the overhead of production-grade **authentication**.

### What This Is Not

- **A Production-Ready Boilerplate:** This template is **not** intended for direct deployment to production. It intentionally omits critical production features like email verification, comprehensive logging, robust error handling, and third-party OAuth to maintain its focus on rapid prototyping. While it _can_ be deployed (e.g., to Vercel), that is a consequence of the stack, not the intended design.
- **A Full-Fledged SaaS Starter:** It lacks the necessary components for a multi-tenant, production-grade Software-as-a-Service application, such as subscription management, team features, and administrative dashboards.

## 2. ðŸŽ¯ Must Haves (Core Functionality)

These are the non-negotiable features required for the template to feel like a premium, modern AI chat application. The focus is on polishing the core user experience to be an absolute joy.

### 2.1 The Core Chat Loop

- UX Goal: The user can send a message and receive a real-time, streaming response from the AI, creating a seamless and interactive conversation.
